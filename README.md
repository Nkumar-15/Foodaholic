# Foodaholic

Foodaholic is a community where people tend to enjoy their quality time with food. This community aims to connect food
producers and food consumers in the same and different geographic region; to develop more self-reliant and strong food networks,
improve local economies in a particular place. Our Project helps like-tasted people to connect and share their experiences about the
tasty foods they enjoyed in the restaurant and suggest to the foodies who is new to the town. It brings out the small unknown food
places where they provide delicious foods with different varieties. Our community provides food tours to the people based different
kinds of packages based on days and restaurants and helps people to connect with different kinds of people and they can enrich their
knowledge about the foods. This community promotes small scale food stalls by the means of the local people and make them
recognizable in the city.
